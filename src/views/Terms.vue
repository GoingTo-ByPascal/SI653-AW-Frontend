                            We may occasionally make changes to this Agreement and the Services for various reasons; for
                            example, to reflect changes in legislation or its requirements, by new features or by

                            the Services in the section. If we make material changes that affect your rights or
                            obligations, we will notify you in advance using reasonable means, such as through the
                            Services or by email. If you continue to use the Services after the changes take effect, you
                            understand that you accept the revised Agreement.</h4>

If you do so, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for GoingTo, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials.

                        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">GoingTo is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.

You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in "Settings" in the Service, however if you use a third party payment account, you will need to manage in app purchases through such account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing. GoingTo may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and GoingTo: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.</h4>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">Though GoingTo strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, it is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow GoingTo’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service.

GoingTo's license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that GoingTo's license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For example, GoingTo would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that GoingTo can prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize GoingTo to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other members or third parties.

Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones.
